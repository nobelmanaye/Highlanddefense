# Bugs:

Time remaining can sometimes go to the negative- dont worry it means you are close to winning. 

Every time you win/lose a game, you have to quit and restart it from the cmd, otherwise the the time remaining bar would not work. 

Some of the units could spill over to the UI board (Don't worry most will go back). 

Some of the units could get stuck during pathing ( They will find their way, but you could "nudge" them to make it faster)

Your soldiers are a very passionate people. In pursuing an enemy, they can at times go beyond the screen's limits and disappear( rare bug). Their sacrifices are not in vain. 


Unlike age of empires, there is no population limit. Hence especially at hard level, a lot of units could be produced which significantly lags the code.
